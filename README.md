Blinkit Power BI Sales and Operations Dashboard

This Power BI project focuses on analyzing the performance of Blinkit (a
quick-commerce platform) by transforming raw business data into actionable visual
insights. The dashboard covers a wide range of business KPIs such as revenue trends, customer behavior, operational performance, and product sales. The dataset includes order details, customer demographics, delivery times, revenue metrics, and product categories. Using Power BI's interactive visuals, slicers, and DAX formulas, I built a dynamic reporting environment that allows stakeholders
to make informed decisions about marketing, inventory, and logistics. 

Project Goals:

 Analyze sales performance across time, regions, and product categories. 
 Understand customer buying patterns and behavior. 
 Measure operational efficiency including delivery time and logistics delays. 
 Provide a centralized reporting dashboard for business stakeholders. 
 Enable forecasting, segmentation, and deep insights through interactive
visuals. 

Key features include:
 Revenue trendlines and comparisons across time frames
 Customer segmentation and retention insights
 Delivery efficiency dashboards by location and time
 Category-level sales performance
 Geo-mapping for city-wise order density
 Forecasting tools for inventory and sales planning

This project showcases my proficiency in Power BI, data modeling, DAX, interactive dashboard design, and storytelling with data — all applied in a real-world business context. 


Sales Analysis :
Revenue Trends: Monthly and weekly revenue visualizations allow tracking of
growth, peak months, and seasonal patterns. 

Product Category Performance: Charts and KPIs to identify best-selling categories
(e.g., groceries, snacks, beverages). 

Top-Selling Products: Highlighted top 10 items based on units sold and revenue, aiding inventory planning.



Customer Analysis :

Customer Segmentation: Distinction between new and returning customers using
DAX calculated columns. 

Churn Analysis: Identification of inactive users and declining purchase frequency.

Order Frequency Heatmap: Weekly and daily order behavior patterns were
visualized to optimize marketing timing. 



Operations & Delivery Performance:

Average Delivery Time by City/Area: Visuals help determine which areas face
delays. 

Delivery Status KPIs: On-time vs delayed deliveries with conditional formatting.

Cost per Delivery Analysis: Helps identify expensive routes or inefficient zones. 



Geographical Insights:

Map Visuals: City-wise and zone-wise delivery heatmaps to identify demand
hotspots and under-served areas.

State-level Metrics: Breakdown of orders, revenue, and delivery efficiency by region. 



Forecasting & Trend Analysis:

Time-Series Forecasting: Implemented for future order predictions using Power BI’s

analytics features. Growth Comparison Charts: Year-over-year and month-over-month comparisons.

Outlier Detection: Visual filters to identify spikes or drops in sales/delivery.



Technical Implementation :

Tools Used: Power BI Desktop, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), Power Query, Custom Visuals

Data Sources: Excel/CSV data containing orders, customers, delivery logs, product
categories, and location data

Data Modeling: Star schema with fact tables (orders, deliveries) and dimension tables
(products, customers, time)

Interactivity: Slicers for date range, product category, customer type, and delivery
zones
